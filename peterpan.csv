"52",16,""
"53",16,"All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow"
"54",16,"up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old"
"55",16,"she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with"
"56",16,"it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for"
"57",16,"Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, ""Oh, why can't you"
"58",16,"remain like this for ever!"" This was all that passed between them on"
"59",16,"the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always"
"60",16,"know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end."
"61",16,""
"62",16,"Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and"
"63",16,"until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady,"
"64",16,"with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic"
"65",16,"mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the"
"66",16,"puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and"
"67",16,"her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get,"
"68",16,"though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner."
"69",16,""
"70",16,"The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been"
"71",16,"boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,"
"72",16,"and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who"
"73",16,"took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,"
"74",16,"except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and"
"75",16,"in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could"
"76",16,"have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a"
"77",16,"passion, slamming the door."
"78",16,""
"79",16,"Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him"
"80",16,"but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks"
"81",16,"and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,"
"82",16,"and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that"
"83",16,"would have made any woman respect him."
"84",16,""
"85",16,"Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books"
"86",16,"perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a"
"87",16,"Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped"
"88",16,"out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces."
"89",16,"She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs."
"90",16,"Darling's guesses."
"91",16,""
"92",16,"Wendy came first, then John, then Michael."
"93",16,""
"94",16,"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would"
"95",16,"be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was"
"96",16,"frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the"
"97",16,"edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,"
"98",16,"while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what"
"99",16,"might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece"
"100",16,"of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at"
"101",16,"the beginning again."
"102",16,""
"103",16,"""Now don't interrupt,"" he would beg of her."
"104",16,""
"105",16,"""I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can"
"106",16,"cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine"
"107",16,"and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five"
"108",16,"naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that"
"109",16,"moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don't speak, my own--and"
"110",16,"the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot"
"111",16,"and carry child--there, you've done it!--did I say nine nine seven? yes,"
"112",16,"I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on"
"113",16,"nine nine seven?"""
"114",16,""
"115",16,"""Of course we can, George,"" she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy's"
"116",16,"favour, and he was really the grander character of the two."
"117",16,""
"118",16,"""Remember mumps,"" he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went"
"119",16,"again. ""Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay"
"120",16,"it will be more like thirty shillings--don't speak--measles one five,"
"121",16,"German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don't waggle your"
"122",16,"finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings""--and so on it went, and"
"123",16,"it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,"
"124",16,"with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated"
"125",16,"as one."
"126",16,""
"127",16,"There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower"
"128",16,"squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of"
"129",16,"them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by"
"130",16,"their nurse."
"131",16,""
"132",16,"Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a"
"133",16,"passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had"
"134",16,"a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children"
"135",16,"drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had"
"136",16,"belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had"
"137",16,"always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become"
"138",16,"acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her"
"139",16,"spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless"
"140",16,"nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their"
"141",16,"mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough"
"142",16,"she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her"
"143",16,"charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery."
"144",16,"She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience"
"145",16,"with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her"
"146",16,"last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of"
"147",16,"contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a"
"148",16,"lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking"
"149",16,"sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them"
"150",16,"back into line if they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer"
"151",16,"was called football, ""footer"" for short] days she never once forgot his"
"152",16,"sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of"
"153",16,"rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the"
"154",16,"nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that"
"155",16,"was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior"
"156",16,"social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She"
"157",16,"resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they"
"158",16,"did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the"
"159",16,"one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's"
"160",16,"hair."
"161",16,""
"162",16,"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and"
"163",16,"Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the"
"164",16,"neighbours talked."
"165",16,""
"166",16,"He had his position in the city to consider."
"167",16,""
"168",16,"Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that"
"169",16,"she did not admire him. ""I know she admires you tremendously, George,"""
"170",16,"Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children"
"171",16,"to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the"
"172",16,"only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget"
"173",16,"she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when"
"174",16,"engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!"
"175",16,"And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that"
"176",16,"all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her"
"177",16,"you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until"
"178",16,"the coming of Peter Pan."
"179",16,""
"180",16,"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's"
"181",16,"minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children"
"182",16,"are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next"
"183",16,"morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have"
"184",16,"wandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you"
"185",16,"can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it"
"186",16,"very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You"
"187",16,"would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of"
"188",16,"your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up,"
"189",16,"making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as"
"190",16,"if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight."
"191",16,"When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with"
"192",16,"which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom"
"193",16,"of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your"
"194",16,"prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on."
"195",16,""
"196",16,"I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind."
"197",16,"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can"
"198",16,"become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a"
"199",16,"child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all"
"200",16,"the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a"
"201",16,"card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is"
"202",16,"always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here"
"203",16,"and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and"
"204",16,"savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves"
"205",16,"through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a"
"206",16,"hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose."
"207",16,"It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day"
"208",16,"at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,"
"209",16,"hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting"
"210",16,"into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth"
"211",16,"yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are"
"212",16,"another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially"
"213",16,"as nothing will stand still."
"214",16,""
"215",16,"Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a"
"216",16,"lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while"
"217",16,"Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over"
"218",16,"it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in"
"219",16,"a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no"
"220",16,"friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by"
"221",16,"its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,"
"222",16,"and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have"
"223",16,"each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play"
"224",16,"are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been"
"225",16,"there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no"
"226",16,"more."
"227",16,""
"228",16,"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most"
"229",16,"compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between"
"230",16,"one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by"
"231",16,"day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming,"
"232",16,"but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That"
"233",16,"is why there are night-lights."
"234",16,""
"235",16,"Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling"
"236",16,"found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most"
"237",16,"perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was"
"238",16,"here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be"
"239",16,"scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than"
"240",16,"any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had"
"241",16,"an oddly cocky appearance."
"242",16,""
"243",16,"""Yes, he is rather cocky,"" Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had"
"244",16,"been questioning her."
"245",16,""
"246",16,"""But who is he, my pet?"""
"247",16,""
"248",16,"""He is Peter Pan, you know, mother."""
"249",16,""
"250",16,"At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her"
"251",16,"childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the"
"252",16,"fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he"
"253",16,"went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened."
"254",16,"She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and"
"255",16,"full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person."
"256",16,""
"257",16,"""Besides,"" she said to Wendy, ""he would be grown up by this time."""
"258",16,""
"259",16,"""Oh no, he isn't grown up,"" Wendy assured her confidently, ""and he is"
"260",16,"just my size."" She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she"
"261",16,"didn't know how she knew, she just knew it."
"262",16,""
"263",16,"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. ""Mark my"
"264",16,"words,"" he said, ""it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their"
"265",16,"heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it"
"266",16,"will blow over."""
"267",16,""
"268",16,"But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs."
"269",16,"Darling quite a shock."
"270",16,""
"271",16,"Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them."
"272",16,"For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event"
"273",16,"happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead"
"274",16,"father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one"
"275",16,"morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been"
"276",16,"found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the"
"277",16,"children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy"
"278",16,"said with a tolerant smile:"
"279",16,""
"280",16,"""I do believe it is that Peter again!"""
"281",16,""
"282",16,"""Whatever do you mean, Wendy?"""
"283",16,""
"284",16,"""It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,"" Wendy said, sighing. She"
"285",16,"was a tidy child."
"286",16,""
"287",16,"She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter"
"288",16,"sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her"
"289",16,"bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she"
"290",16,"didn't know how she knew, she just knew."
"291",16,""
"292",16,"""What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without"
"293",16,"knocking."""
"294",16,""
"295",16,"""I think he comes in by the window,"" she said."
"296",16,""
"297",16,"""My love, it is three floors up."""
"298",16,""
"299",16,"""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?"""
"300",16,""
"301",16,"It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window."
"302",16,""
"303",16,"Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to"
"304",16,"Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming."
"305",16,""
"306",16,"""My child,"" the mother cried, ""why did you not tell me of this before?"""
"307",16,""
"308",16,"""I forgot,"" said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast."
"309",16,""
"310",16,"Oh, surely she must have been dreaming."
"311",16,""
"312",16,"But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined"
"313",16,"them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they"
"314",16,"did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the"
"315",16,"floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She"
"316",16,"rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a"
"317",16,"tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty"
"318",16,"feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by."
"319",16,""
"320",16,"Certainly Wendy had been dreaming."
"321",16,""
"322",16,"But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the"
"323",16,"night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be"
"324",16,"said to have begun."
"325",16,""
"326",16,"On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It"
"327",16,"happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and"
"328",16,"sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into"
"329",16,"the land of sleep."
"330",16,""
"331",16,"All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and"
"332",16,"sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew."
"333",16,""
"334",16,"It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into"
"335",16,"shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three"
"336",16,"night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then"
"337",16,"her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of"
"338",16,"them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the"
"339",16,"fire. There should have been a fourth night-light."
"340",16,""
"341",16,"While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come"
"342",16,"too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not"
"343",16,"alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many"
"344",16,"women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of"
"345",16,"some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures"
"346",16,"the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through"
"347",16,"the gap."
"348",16,""
"349",16,"The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming"
"350",16,"the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor."
"351",16,"He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which"
"352",16,"darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been"
"353",16,"this light that wakened Mrs. Darling."
"354",16,""
"355",16,"She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once"
"356",16,"that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should"
"357",16,"have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He was a lovely"
"358",16,"boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but"
"359",16,"the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth."
"360",16,"When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her."
"361",16,""
"362",16,""
"363",16,""
"364",16,""
"365",16,"Chapter 2 THE SHADOW"
"366",16,""
"367",16,"Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,"
"368",16,"and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang"
"369",16,"at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling"
"370",16,"screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,"
"371",16,"and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it"
"372",16,"was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see"
"373",16,"nothing but what she thought was a shooting star."
"374",16,""
"375",16,"She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth,"
"376",16,"which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had"
"377",16,"closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had"
"378",16,"time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off."
"379",16,""
"380",16,"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was"
"381",16,"quite the ordinary kind."

"1234",16,"Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at"
"1235",16,"the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she had burst"
"1236",16,"into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most"

"2600",16,"unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no"

"2621",16,"After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets"
"2622",16,"in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the"
"2623",16,"ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses"
"2624",16,"should do, with a floor in which you could dig [for worms] if you wanted"
"2625",16,"to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming"
"2626",16,"colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in"
"2627",16,"the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,"
"2628",16,"level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and"
"2629",16,"then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;"
"2630",16,"as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus"
"2631",16,"there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was"
"2632",16,"in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across"
"2633",16,"this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended"
"2634",16,"her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at"
"2635",16,"6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it,"
"2636",16,"except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule"
"2637",16,"against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at"
"2638",16,"once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired]"
"2639",16,"a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the"
"2640",16,"short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket."

"2645",16,"apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of"
"2646",16,"the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious"
"2647",16,"[particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman,"
"2648",16,"however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room]"
"2649",16,"and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was"
"2650",16,"a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads"
"2651",16,"according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a"
"2652",16,"Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to"
"2653",16,"fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest"
"2654",16,"of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the"
"2655",16,"best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier"
"2656",16,"from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the"
"2657",16,"residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house,"
"2658",16,"as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful,"
"2659",16,"looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently"
"2660",16,"turned up."

"2662",16,"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those"
"2663",16,"rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole"
"2664",16,"weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never"
"2665",16,"above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and"
"2666",16,"even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to"

"2669",16,"depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of"
"2670",16,"a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel"
"2671",16,"stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than"
"2672",16,"anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe"
"2673",16,"was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting"
"2674",16,"rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead,"
"2675",16,"and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree"

"2697",16,"calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them"

"2701",16,"her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John"
"2702",16,"remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while"
"2703",16,"Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother."
"2704",16,"These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she"
"2705",16,"tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination"
"2706",16,"papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school."
"2707",16,"The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on"
"2708",16,"joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,"
"2709",16,"writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another"
"2710",16,"slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions--""What"
"2711",16,"was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was"
"2712",16,"Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible."""
"2713",16,"""(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last"

"2717",16,"Kennel and its Inmate."""
"2718",16,""
"2719",16,"They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not"
"2720",16,"answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful"
"2721",16,"what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who"
"2722",16,"replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more"
"2723",16,"hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,"
"2724",16,"and he really came out last: a melancholy thing."
"2725",16,""
"2726",16,"Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except"
"2727",16,"Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could"
"2728",16,"neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that"
"2729",16,"sort of thing."
"2730",16,""
"2731",16,"By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What"
"2732",16,"was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been"
"2733",16,"forgetting, too."
"2734",16,""
"2735",16,"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but"
"2736",16,"about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that"
"2737",16,"fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it,"
"2738",16,"which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games."
"2739",16,"It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of"
"2740",16,"thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools"
"2741",16,"flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and"
"2742",16,"coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter"
"2743",16,"doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking"
"2744",16,"solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to"
"2745",16,"do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For"
"2746",16,"several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and"
"2747",16,"John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would"
"2748",16,"have treated them severely."
"2749",16,""
"2750",16,"He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely"
"2751",16,"certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten"
"2752",16,"it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went"
"2753",16,"out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great"
"2754",16,"deal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came"
"2755",16,"home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed"
"2756",16,"it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never"
"2757",16,"quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she"
"2758",16,"knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still"
"2759",16,"more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and"
"2760",16,"said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as"
"2761",16,"large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can"
"2762",16,"do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The"
"2763",16,"difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the"
"2764",16,"redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and"
"2765",16,"especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which"
"2766",16,"was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the"
"2767",16,"Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way"
"2768",16,"and sometimes that, he called out, ""I'm redskin to-day; what are you,"
"2769",16,"Tootles?"" And Tootles answered, ""Redskin; what are you, Nibs?"" and"
"2770",16,"Nibs said, ""Redskin; what are you Twin?"" and so on; and they were all"
"2771",16,"redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real"
"2772",16,"redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that"
"2773",16,"once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever."
"2774",16,""
"2775",16,"The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided"
"2776",16,"yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one"
"2777",16,"would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground,"
"2778",16,"when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out"
"2779",16,"like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the"
"2780",16,"Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally."
"2781",16,""
"2782",16,"Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might"
"2783",16,"eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after"
"2784",16,"another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so"
"2785",16,"that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and"
"2786",16,"was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark."
"2787",16,""
"2788",16,"Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly"
"2789",16,"of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how"
"2790",16,"the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and"
"2791",16,"Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty"
"2792",16,"story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell"
"2793",16,"it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would"
"2794",16,"of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter"
"2795",16,"adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the"
"2796",16,"help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a"
"2797",16,"great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and"
"2798",16,"Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might"
"2799",16,"choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him"
"2800",16,"on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he"
"2801",16,"waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly"
"2802",16,"from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge."
"2803",16,""
"2804",16,"Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss"
"2805",16,"for it."
"2806",16,""
"2807",16,"I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that"
"2808",16,"the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I could do it"
"2809",16,"again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick"
"2810",16,"to the lagoon."

"2834",16,"irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within"
"2835",16,"a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her"
"2836",16,"with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally."
"2837",16,""
"2838",16,"They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who"
"2839",16,"chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails"
"2840",16,"when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs."
"2841",16,""
"2842",16,"The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,"
"2843",16,"when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for"
"2844",16,"mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy"
"2845",16,"had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course"
"2846",16,"Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules"
"2847",16,"about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,"
"2848",16,"however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in"
"2849",16,"extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many"
"2850",16,"colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily"

"2852",16,"rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and"

"2855",16,"pretty sight."
"2856",16,""
"2857",16,"But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by"
"2858",16,"themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we"
"2859",16,"have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not"
"2860",16,"above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting"
"2861",16,"the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted"

"4233",16,"pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,"
"4234",16,"not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed,"
"4235",16,"the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air"
"4236",16,"was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late."

"4412",16,""
"4413",16,"He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,"

"4416",16,"took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long"
"4417",16,"sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter"

"4419",16,""
"4420",16,"Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for"
"4421",16,"a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no"
"4422",16,"doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care."
"4423",16,"Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he"
"4424",16,"lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she"
"4425",16,"had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may"
"4426",16,"not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but"
"4427",16,"it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he"
"4428",16,"laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it."
"4429",16,""
"4430",16,"Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful"

"4433",16,"think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been"
"4434",16,"Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,"
"4435",16,"soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer"
"4436",16,"to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should"
"4437",16,"not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this"
"4438",16,"occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped"
"4439",16,"over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of"
"4440",16,"his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little"
"4441",16,"pearls."
"4442",16,""
"4443",16,"Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree"
"4444",16,"looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion"
"4445",16,"disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers"
"4446",16,"(I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on"
"4447",16,"the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of"
"4448",16,"the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would"
"4449",16,"have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing."
"4450",16,""
"4451",16,"What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept. The"
"4452",16,"open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a"
"4453",16,"personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one"
"4454",16,"may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They"
"4455",16,"steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces"
"4456",16,"every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the"
"4457",16,"sleeper."
"4458",16,""
"4459",16,"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in"
"4460",16,"darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered"
"4461",16,"an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not entirely fill the"
"4462",16,"aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch,"
"4463",16,"he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his"
"4464",16,"disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's"
"4465",16,"face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung"
"4466",16,"himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?"
"4467",16,""
"4468",16,"But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's"
"4469",16,"medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was"
"4470",16,"straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power."
"4471",16,""
"4472",16,"Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a"
"4473",16,"dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that"
"4474",16,"had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow"
"4475",16,"liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent"
"4476",16,"poison in existence."
"4477",16,""
"4478",16,"Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook, but it"
"4479",16,"was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing"
"4480",16,"at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid"
"4481",16,"spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and"
"4482",16,"turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged"
"4483",16,"at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole."
"4484",16,"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him,"
"4485",16,"holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night,"
"4486",16,"of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself,"
"4487",16,"stole away through the trees."
"4488",16,""
"4489",16,"Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out,"
"4490",16,"leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been"
"4491",16,"not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in"
"4492",16,"his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on"
"4493",16,"the door of his tree."
"4494",16,""
"4495",16,"Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for"

"4959",16,"with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the"
"4960",16,"crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by"
"4961",16,"and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought"
"4962",16,"this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down."
"4963",16,""
"4964",16,"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a"
"4965",16,"fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter"
"4966",16,"began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use;"
"4967",16,"and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the"
"4968",16,"crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one"
"4969",16,"unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,"
"4970",16,"and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what"
"4971",16,"it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again"
"4972",16,"ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a"
"4973",16,"fixed idea, it was a stupid beast."

"4975",16,"Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs"
"4976",16,"encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new"
"4977",16,"element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human"
"4978",16,"of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: ""Hook or me this"
"4979",16,"time."" He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing"
"4980",16,"that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board"

"4987",16,""
"4988",16,"The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the"

"4991",16,"himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. ""How clever of me!"""

"5205",16,"when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking"
"5206",16,"wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man"
"5207",16,"they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which"
"5208",16,"enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the"
"5209",16,"miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they"
"5210",16,"were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern"
"5211",16,"which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and"
"5212",16,"fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was"
"5213",16,"little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional"
"5214",16,"screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven"
"5215",16,"eight--nine--ten--eleven."
"5216",16,""
"5217",16,"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who"

"5220",16,"match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and"
"5221",16,"again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,"
"5222",16,"and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just"
"5223",16,"passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray."

"5243",16,"rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got"
"5244",16,"past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead,"
"5245",16,"and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in"

"5247",16,"the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite"
"5248",16,"thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment"
"5249",16,"he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to"
"5250",16,"close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had"
"5251",16,"been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,"
"5252",16,"pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar"
"5253",16,"colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's"
