**Text Analysis Special Topics Timeline (14ish weeks in the semester)**
* Meet once a week for ~1 hour
* Schedule 1-2 hours to work on it per day
* Maybe spill over into January term / comps project

**Weeks 1-3**
* Look at other iNZight packages and see how they wrote theirs - 2 weeks?
  * There is public access to the iNZight Github as well as lots of the packages that are written for the modules
* Decide which functions and packages I’ll need to write the package - 1 week?
  * I’ve already got some of this but will be doing some more thinking about which wrapper functions to create for my package

**Weeks 4-9**
* Create package - probably the longest part - 6 weeks?
* Follow structure of previously written packages
* Here is where you decide which features the user needs
  * Which variables will they need? How many of them will they be able to pick/modify on their own? → Chris and I already         talked about this quite a bit
* Trial and error to see which functions work and which ones don’t
  * Could write simple shiny in conjunction with this just to be sure that my functions are working properly?
* Can make sure that datasets are being cleaned and visualized properly by using package and toy examples

**Weeks 10-14**
* After the package is created, I can try and create the module - 5 weeks?
  * Guy from NZ who did maps module says that Tom (who works with iNZight) often helps a lot with creating the actual module since it can be tricky

**Further Notes**
* Should I add in some supplemental material in addition to working on the text analysis module? 
  * There are quite a few classes for text mining and analysis that I could be pulling things from.
